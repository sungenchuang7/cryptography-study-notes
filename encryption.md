# Encryption

## What Is Encryption? 
* Process by which plain text data becomes hidden 
* Ciphered data becomes difficult, hopefully impossible, to read without the ***key*** that was used to generate the ciphered text. 
* Therefore, only authorized parties can decrypt 

## Goals of Encryption
* **Confidentiality** (= privacy):
> The message I send you is only readable by you, assuming that two of us share an algo and some sort of key parlance between us. 
* **Integrity**: 
> What you send me has not been modified by a bad actor. 
* **Authentication**:
> You are who you say you are .
* **Nonrepudiation**:
> Prove a message came from who you believe sent it &rarr; the goal of ***digital signatures***
